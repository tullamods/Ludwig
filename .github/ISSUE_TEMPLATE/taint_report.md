> :warning: Due to the nature of taint, errors can easily be blamed by the client on the wrong addon. When running multiple ones, it is generally not clear which caused the issue. Tracking down the cause can also be complicated.

**Which software were you running?**
 - Addon version:
 - Client used: [e.g. Vanilla 1.14.4, Retail PTR x.x.x, etc]

**Please describe how to reproduce it.**
Steps to reproduce the behaviour:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

 **Have you tried disabling all other addons and verified the problem remains?**
 Mark if read.
